## **Match the Dragon**
### A game of memory

[Try it out!](https://matchthedragon.herokuapp.com/)

Flip the cards and see if you can match them using your memory. 

**Utilizing:** 
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- jQuery
- and ready for Sass

*All images sourced from Google.*

**Problems:** 
(ran out of time)
- Prompt to select a 2nd card does not disappear after 2nd card chosen
- Prompt messages aggregate in sidebar 
- Cards are not hidden when matched
- Cards do not flip back over if not matched
- No score
- All cards can be flipped...so the game does not end
- No game over alert
- Squares dot not always stay in the same formation (4x4 grid)- possible a jQuery plugin issue?

**Goals:** 
- To fix all aforementioned problems
- Multiplayer function with 1 player/Multiplayer buttons
- Card count per player
- Games won count per player 
- "Congratulations" message to winning player
- Music: "Puff the Magic Dragon" variations; with on/off button

**Approach:** 
- Break things down
  - Wrote out every game step in English and Sudo code-
- Make things as visual as possible as early as possible
    - Used images and jQuery grid plugin
